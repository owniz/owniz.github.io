Summer break is here I have a lot of free time. Oddly enough with the amount of free time going up my Github contributions seem to be inversely proportional.

In light of this I want to say thanks to all of you who are forking this [repo](https://github.com/getmicah/getmicah.github.io) and for all of 
those emailing me and [tweeting](https://twitter.com/getmicah) at me. Also I am looking for some web work to make some money over the summer 
so
